  <li>Realtors charge 3-6% of the sale price of a home to broker the deal. 
  <li>We'd like to keep that $20,000+ in our pockets, and those of the buyer! 
  <li>If we can come to an agreement on the terms and conditions for the sale, our attorneys can work out the details, and we can save a lot of money.
  <li>If you think that a realtor would add value on your side of the deal, you are welcome to use one, and pay them for their services.
  <li>Check Zillow for current valuation. While it doesn't include some of the special features of this house, like copper gutters, and the woodwork, it gives a range of prices.
