    <td>
 <ul>
  <li>Outside needs to be repainted. We needed to wait until the roof and gutters were done, so now it's ready. You get to pick the colors!
  <li>Garage chimney could use some attention. Since it's unused and stable, you could just let it sit, or redo it, or put a metal cap on it to stabilize it.
  <li>A couple of bathroom tile pieces (2) could be replaced. We meant to find the replacements for the powder room soap holder and one of the towel bar supports, but never got around to it. Find originals at house parts or replace with reproductions.
  <li>One more attic window needs to be restored. You may want to replace it with an exit window depending whether you'd want sleeping space on the third floor.
